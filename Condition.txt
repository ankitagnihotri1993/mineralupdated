    1. When the invoice in caliber has Positive Balance(With all positive lines)
        We need to create that as INVOICE (* BILL API *)

    2. When the invoice in caliber has Positive Balance(With Positive lines and With few Negative Lines - Vendor Credit)
       We need to create that as INVOICE.Because the Negative Line amount automatically
       deducts the balance from invoice and make the invoice with only Positive balance
    eg: $100  Invoice with
    (a) $150 Positive line(Vendor credit flag unchecked),
    (b) $50 Negative Line(Vendor Credit flag Checked)(* BILL API *)
    Balance is automatically adjusted and remaining will be available for payment.


    3. When then invoice in caliber has Negative Balance(With one or more Negative Lines - vendor credit flag checked at all the lines)..We need to create that as CREDIT * (CREDIT API)*


    4. When the invoice in caliber has Negative Balance(With Positive Lines and With few Negative Lines - Vendor Credit) � We need to create that as CREDIT.Because the Negative Line amount automatically deducts the balance from invoice and make the invoice with only Negative balance
    eg: -($100)  Invoice with (a) $50 Positive line(Vendor credit flag unchecked), (b) - ($150) Negative Line(Vendor Credit flag Checked)


   Balance is automatically adjusted and remaining will be available for Credit payment to be applied to some other invoices. (CREDIT API)

    About #3 and #4, since we don�t have a credit application concept in MT we may not need to sync the CREDITS / Negative Balance Invoices(Also known as Open Vendor Credits) that are not applied or used to any Positive Balance invoice

    So Sync #1 and #2 cases as Open invoices(Bill API), just as simple Invoices with both Positive and Negative Balance lines.-- Total balance to be Positive

    and for Cases #3 and #4 sync them only if they are applied to any other Positive Invoices as a Credit Payments - Which is equivalent to applying Credits to a Invoices using Bill Credits API

    Is this clear..?

if you can not distinguish or separate the #3 and #4 cases and filter to get only the ones that are applied to Positive invoices.That should be fine as well..They will be just displayed in MT as Open CREDITS(Credits API)
